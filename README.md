# HEY YOU !

Let me introduce myself, my name is [**ZUKHRUF**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zukhruf/).<br>

I am an **Ordinary Student** at the [**SUMATERA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY**](https://www.itera.ac.id/).<br>

I just made this for fun because I studied at [dicoding](https://www.dicoding.com/).<br>

I don't know what will happen in the future,

Hopefully I can become a DEVELOPER at [GOOGLE](https://www.google.com/) hehe.<br>

or become an IoT Engineer at [Intel](https://www.intel.co.id/content/www/id/id/internet-of-things/overview.html).<br>

I like learning new things and am enthusiastic about things that are interesting, not pushy :)

hehe it's not funny, that's right! the name is [learning](https://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belajar).<br>
